Question:- What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.



Answer:-

Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to make decisions in code based on certain conditions. They allow your program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The most common types of conditional statements in JavaScript are 'if', 'else if', and 'else'. Here's a brief explanation of each along with their syntax and examples:

1. **if statement:**

   The 'if' statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

   **syntax**
   if (condition) {
       // Code 
   }
   

   **Example:**

   
   let x = 10;

   if (x > 5) {
       console.log("x is greater than 5");
   }
   

2. **else if statement:**

   The 'else if' statement is used in conjunction with the 'if' statement to provide additional conditions to be checked if the initial 'if' condition is false.

   **Syntax**

   if (condition1) {
       // Code 
   } else if (condition2) {
       // Code 
   }
   

   **Example:**

   
   let y = 7;

   if (y > 10) {
       console.log("y is greater than 10");
   } else if (y > 5) {
       console.log("y is greater than 5 but not greater than 10");
   }
   

3. **else statement:**

   The 'else' statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions is true.

   **syntax**
   if (condition1) {
       // Code
   } else {
       // Code
   }
   

   **Example:**

   
   let z = 3;

   if (z > 5) {
       console.log("z is greater than 5");
   } else {
       console.log("z is not greater than 5");
   }

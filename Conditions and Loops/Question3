Question3:-

Answer:-

Loops in JavaScript are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. They provide a way to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over collections of data. JavaScript has several types of loops, and each serves a different purpose. The main types of loops are 'for', 'while', and 'do-while'.

1. **'for' loop:**
   - The 'for' loop is used when the number of iterations is known or can be determined.

   **syntax**
   for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
       // Code 
   }


   **Example:**

   
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       console.log(i);
   }
   

2. **'while' loop:**
   - The 'while' loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition is true.

   **syntax**
   while (condition) {
       // Code 
   }
   

   **Example:**

   
   let i = 0;

   while (i < 5) {
       console.log(i);
       i++;
   }
 

3. **'do-while' loop:**
   - The 'do-while' loop is similar to the 'while' loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

   **syntax**
   do {
       // Code 
   } while (condition);
   

   **Example:**

   
   let i = 0;

   do {
       console.log(i);
       i++;
   } while (i < 5);
